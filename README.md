# How to directly link to an image

If youre reading this you linked to an imgur album or a gfycat page instead of directly linking to the image. Loading the site wastes the time of everyone clicking your link when you only wanted to show them a image and they only wanted to see the image. The site doesnt add any value to anybody involved. 

Take this link for example: https://imgur.com/a/xwTSWon 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oreganon/not-directly-linking-to-the-image-autistiny-clap/master/2019-01-26_01-08.png" alt="autistiny" />

It takes you 2.7s (DOMContentLoaded) until you see the image.

Now with a direct link to the image: https://i.imgur.com/hC11Pkd.png

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oreganon/not-directly-linking-to-the-image-autistiny-clap/master/2019-01-26_01-09.png" alt="godstiny" />

It only takes 34ms. Thats 79x faster.

## But I dont know how to directly link to an image

Right click the image and select the appropriate entry.

Firefox: 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oreganon/not-directly-linking-to-the-image-autistiny-clap/master/2019-01-26_01-18.png" alt="godstiny" />

Chrome OsKrappa:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oreganon/not-directly-linking-to-the-image-autistiny-clap/master/2019-01-26_01-26.png" alt="godstiny" />
