# How to directly link to an image and not waste everybodys time

If youre reading this you linked to an imgur album or a gfycat page or some other shitty site instead of directly linking to the image. Loading the site wastes the time of everyone clicking your link when you only wanted to show them a image and they only wanted to see the image. The site doesnt add any value to anybody involed. 

Take this link for example: https://imgur.com/a/xwTSWon 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oreganon/not-directly-linking-to-the-image-autistiny-clap/master/2019-01-26_01-08.png" alt="autistiny" />

It takes you 2.7s (DOMContentLoaded) until you see the image.

Now with a direct link to the image: https://i.imgur.com/hC11Pkd.png

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oreganon/not-directly-linking-to-the-image-autistiny-clap/master/2019-01-26_01-09.png" alt="godstiny" />

It only takes 34ms.

## But this is my first day on the internet I dont know how to directly link to an image

Right click the image and select the appropriate entry.

Firefox: 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oreganon/not-directly-linking-to-the-image-autistiny-clap/master/2019-01-26_01-18.png" alt="godstiny" />

Chrome OsKrappa:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oreganon/not-directly-linking-to-the-image-autistiny-clap/master/2019-01-26_01-26.png" alt="godstiny" />
